                Participated in a rigorous and interactive STEM curriculum focusing on topics such as probability, statistics, computer programming, data analysis, and game theory. In addition to these topics, classes regarding combinatorics, number theory and computer science were taught alongside homework and in-class assignments. This program was held throughout 5-weeks and the topics were extensively taught by experienced instructors and teaching assistants.

                I assisted mentors at Camp Foster, a Boys and Girls Club summer camp in Bedford, NH. At this camp, I assisted mentors within the STEM center, learning center, and nature center. At the STEM center, I would help curate STEM projects for the kids to learn different science and engineering concepts. For the learning center, I created lesson plans, tutored several students, and held assisted reading sessions. Lastly at the nature center, I would help create activities for the kids to do in the woods and would help make sure that everyone was safe while playing. Throughout my time volunteering for the camp, I was able to effectively communicate with staff to create fun projects for students and I earned over 60 hours of volunteering.

                I managed tutors within the chapter and assigned them projects. These projects consisted of either tutoring a specific student we had assigned to the New Hampshire chapter, or them creating worksheets that could be utilized by other students that received help from the organization. I would also hold meetings for all students within the chapter to discuss the progress everyone has made in terms of tutoring and constructing worksheets. During these meetings, I wrote descriptions of what each tutor worked on to document the progress of the chapter and made sure that I helped any tutors that had questions. Through this, I was able to effectively guide the tutors within the chapter toward success. In addition to this aspect of my role, I organized meetings to provide feedback to tutors and made sure that they always had something to do. Apart from managing the students within the chapter, I also tutored students in elementary schools focusing on math. Overall, I earned 50 volunteering hours managing and tutoring for the chapter.

                I managed students within the business and art sub-teams for Team 2342 and created a plan every meeting containing projects for all of the members to work on. These projects included things such as updating the team's binders, creating newsletters, applying to numerous awards throughout the season and decorating the robot, the team merchandise, and the team's station. I would also go to competitions to speak with judges about the team's vision, show them the documentation we kept of the season, and explain how parts of the robot were designed/worked. The business sub-team's effort led the team to win an Entrepreneurship Award during competition season which was the first one we've won for years. Apart from leading the business sub-team, I organized the team's budget and expenses for the season through a spreadsheet, and made sure that the team's purchases were viable.

                Original C++ FlappyBird clone game designed for Arduino's that are connected to an external LED matrix display. The game starts by asking the user to press and hold the middle button until the game begins. Once this is done, the game will then begin and the user can press the left and right buttons to control the bird up and down. Pipes of randomly generated heights (heights that will always allow space for the user to go through) will go across the screen and the user will have to avoid them to gain a higher score. In addition to the random heights, the further you get into the game, the faster it gets, and the pipe's will come in at randomly generated time intervals so it doesn't get repetitive. Once the game ends, the user's score is displayed onto an LED panel, and the high score for the game will also be display. Lastly, the user will be reprompted to play the game and will wait again for them to hold the middle button. This game was created using C++ within Arduino IDE.

                Used a U-Net model to train a neural network (that is constructed using a training loop) that is then tested against a testing set sample. In addition the optimizer function uses the ADAM algorithm and the loss function uses binary-cross entropy. 50 epochs were trained in total and then the best performing epoch was utilized to represented as the best model. The accuracy of the model was then tested to be about 98.4%. An accuracy and confusion matrix were then created to analyze the performance of the model by showing the true-positives that the model detected, and the true negatives that the model detected.

                I used different ball, brick, and player objects to operate the game, and it works by generating a brick object layout that is contained in a list with the areas of their hitbox being held within the object. As the ball moves with general ball physics, it detects whether the top left corner of the ball comes into contact with any of the hitboxes of the brick objects by looping through each box object and checking whether the location of the ball is within the space of a brick. If so, the brick object is deleted and the score counter is incremented. The ball has physics that reacts to how far it hits the player's platform which influences its velocity and direction. Apart from these aspects, there is a score counter that takes into account how many bricks were broken by the ball, and a ball spawner with the letter b that starts the game.

                Homeless shelters and organizations were contacted and interviewed using a questionnaire that focused on the effects the pandemic had on their organization and how they believe it affected the homeless people. Their responses were then compiled and turned into easily interpretive data that could be used to gain a better understanding of the issue. This project shows that from the responses garnered from the participants, 61.5% believed the pandemic overall negatively impacted homeless people, 41.5% believed that government didn't do a sufficient job to help the homeless during the pandemic and that 53.8% of organizations reported a slight influx of people using homeless services.

                Although deicers benefit transportation and improve road safety, their effects are detrimental to infrastructure and the environment. Chloride levels have been shown to increase across many streams, and the deterioration of roads has become prominent. With sodium chloride and its alternatives causing such damage, it is important to analyze the effects it has on infrastructure to minimize damage. The hypothesis for the experiment was that the deicing solutions would cause discoloration and damage the durability of the concrete/pavement. The data partially proved parts of the research hypothesis claiming that the use of deicers would cause discoloration. The part within the hypothesis that was disproven was that the use of deicers would cause immediate damage to the durability of both the concrete and pavement. There did not appear to be a formation of cracks within any of the crates and the road surfaces did not seem to weaken.
